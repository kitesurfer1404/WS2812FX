WS2182FX Change Log


v1.4.1 changes 07/18/2022
-------------------------

1) Since ESP and Arduino microprocessors now have separate header
	files (see v1.4.0 change log notes), the 15 custom effects were
	added as built-in effects for ESP (and RP2040) devices. The
	mechanism to add custom effects is still available for Arduino
	projects (see the ws2812fx_custom_effect2 example sketch), but
	with limited memory, you'll need to pick and choose the custom
	effects that you want included in Arduino projects.
	The following effects are now built-in for ESP and RP2040 devices:
		Block Dissolve
		ICU
		Dual Larson
		Running Random2
		Filler Up
		Rainbow Larson
		Rainbow Fireworks
		Trifade
		VU Meter
		Heartbeat
		Bits
		Multi Comet
		Flipbook (same as the matrix custom effect)
		Popcorn
		Oscillator

2) The ability to inject external data into some of the "new"
	built-in effects was added. This allows potentially very large
	arrays or data structs to be used by effects and control how
	they behave. The new ws2812fx_extData example sketch demonstrates
	how this can be done. Probably not something for a novice
	developer, but can be a very powerful feature if you know what
	you're doing.

3) renamed the "random_wipe_bright" effect to "running_random2", since
	it's really just a variant of the running_random effect.

4) added getRawPixelColor() and setRawPixelColor() utility functions
	to get/set pixel data without regard to the Adafruit_NeoPixel
	global brightness rigmarole.

5) Modified the rainbow_cycle effect so that it would work well with
	very short segments of LEDs. The timing was slowed down a bit as
	well, so you may need to adjust the speed parameter if you're
	using that effect.

6) Tweaked the blink_rainbow and strobe_rainbow effects, so the
	colors would change more quickly. 

7) Modified the tester.zsh automated testing script to include tests
	for RP2040 processors. examples/tester_Jul2022.txt contains the
	latest test results.


v1.4.0 changes 03/23/2022
-------------------------

1) The source files were getting very big, so I split the .h and .cpp
	files into three .h files and three .cpp files. The files are
	still pretty big, but are now a little more managable.

2) The Arduino's memory limitations are starting to really hinder
	expanding the library's feature set, so I split the header file into
	seperate files for ESP (modes_esp.h) and Arduino (modes_arduino.h).
	Hopefully this will make it easer to add new features/effects for
	ESP devices, and not blow up the memory footprint for Arduino devices.

3) Updated the ws2812fx_patterns_web example sketch to use the
	async web server (ESPAsyncWebServer) instead of ESP8266WebServer,
	so the sketch now supports ESP8266 and ESP32.

4) removed support for the lagacy AduinoJson v5 library in the
	ws2812fx_patterns_web example sketch. You must use the
	ArduinoJson v6 library.

5) Added the tester.zsh script to verify all the example sketches
	for Arduino, ESP8266 and ESP32 devices. Automated
	testing??? What a concept! :)

6) Refactored the modes for ESP devices, so the mode data is stored
	in a struct, and added an effect category to the struct. This
	should have been done long ago, but the tight coupling of Arduino
	and ESP code made it problematic. Hopefully this will spur more
	innovative GUI designs that don't just show one gigantic list
	of effects.

7) POTENTIALLY BREAKING CHANGE
	Changed the timing of the CHASE, TWINKLE_FADE, RUNNING, DYNAMIC
	and Fireworks effects to make them more consistent with the other
	effects. A speed setting of 1000 should give reasonable results
	for all effects. While this isn't strictly a breaking change,
	your speed settings for these effects might need to be tweeked
	to get the same animation rate you had before.

8) Refactored the rainbow_chase effect to be more efficient.


v1.3.6 changes xx/xx/xxxx
-------------------------

1) Added REVERSE option for rainbow_cycle effect and fixed direction
   for rainbow_cycle, theater_chase_rainbow and rain effects so they
   are consistent with he other effects. Thanks @DominikGrudzinski.
   See issue #304.

2) Implemented @FedericoBusero's idea to disable auto_cycle in the
   esp8266_webinterface example sketch when a mode is selected.
   See PR #302.


v1.3.5 changes 11/18/2021
-------------------------

1) When specifying a binary number, changed from "Bxxxx" notation
    to "0bxxxx" notation. Apparently this is the preferred notation,
	since the old notation threw compiler warnings. See issue #292.

2) Minor tweaks to some example sketches to remove compiler warnings.

3) Updated ws2812fx_soundfx example sketch to use LittleFS file
    system instead of SPIFFS.

4) Updated the keywords.txt file.

5) Removed the ws2812fx_esp32 example sketch since the
    Adafruit_Neopixel lib (v1.7.0) implemented an ESP32 RMT driver
    and we can just use that.

6) Fixed a bug in some of the effects that caused the last LED in
    a segment to always be off. See issue #299. Thanks @DanielWeigl
	for catching that.

7) moved the rain effect from a custon effect to a built-in effect.

8) Added "headers": "WS2812FX.h" to the library.json file as
    suggested by @ivankravets in PR #300.


v1.3.4 changes 8/21/2021
------------------------

1) Updated the web interface example sketches to be compatible
    with ESP32 as suggested by kadu in PR #280. Although beware
	of the ESP32 "flickering" issue when using more than a few
	LEDs (issue #223). Use the RMT technique in the ws2812fx_esp32
	example sketch as a workaround.

2) Added setRandomSeed() function to allow greater control of
    random number generation as suggested by schumar in issue #288.

3) Added the ws2812fx_teensy example sketch to demo how to use
    Paul Stoffregen's non-blocking WS2812Serial library for the
	Teensy. Inspired by issue #277.

4) If you aren't using any options in a setSegment() statement,
    you can just omit the option parameter at the end.
	Eg. ws2812fx.setSegment(0, 0, 31, FX_MODE_BLINK, RED, 1000);
	Also setSegment() with no arguments will initialize segment 0
	with reasonable default values.
	Eg. ws2812fx.setSegment() is equivalent to
	    ws2812fx.setSegment(0, 0, getLength()-1, DEFAULT_MODE, DEFAULT_COLOR, DEFAULT_SPEED)

5) Created a generic blend() function, which will eventually be
	used to merge pixel data to create effect transitions.

6) Refactored the color_blend() function to use the new generic
	blend() function. Better performance.

7) Added a new WS2812FXT class to help create effect transitions
	and the ws2812fx_transitions example sketch to demo its use.

8) Started working on some API documentation.

9) Fixed an odd bug in the serial_control example sketch that was
	causing a compile error on Raspberry Pi Pico.


v1.3.3 changes 4/15/2021
------------------------

1) Added bits.h custom effect.

2) Added ws2812fx_matrix and ws2812fx_audio_reactive example sketches.

3) Made twinkleFOX one of the built-in effects, so it doesn't
	need to be included as a custom effect anymore. It's such a
	versatile, universal effect I thought it deserved a spot as
	a built-in effect.

4) Significant rewrite of the ws2812fx_segments_web example sketch.
	The web app now gets all of its resources from the ESP (instead
	of retrieving them from the Internet), and I've added some
	new features.

5) Some minor code cleanup (changed data type boolean to bool).


v1.3.2 changes 9/19/2020
------------------------

1) Fixed a bug in esp8266_webinterface example sketch, which was
	causing issues with auto cycle mode if you used the myModes[]
	array to create a custom list of effects.

2) Added code to properly initialize the segment pointers. Fixes
	a bug that caused a crash if you tried to manipulate an LED's
	color without first calling the strip's service() function.

3) Added the ws2812fx_overlay and ws2812fx_spi example sketches.


v1.3.1 changes 6/2/2020
------------------------

1) Changed _modes[] to a static array. Saves a bunch of flash
	and SRAM memory when instantiating more than one WS2812FX object.

2) Added ws2812fx_virtual_strip example sketch to demonstrate how to
	use setPixels() to manage the Adafruit_NeoPixel pixel data.

3) Changed RUNNING_COLOR effect so that the background color is
	set to colors[1] instead of hardcoded to WHITE. The default
	background color will be BLACK now. Set color[1]=WHITE if
	you want the old behavior.

4) Updated the README.md file.


v1.3.0 changes 5/11/2020
------------------------

1) This library now makes use of the new Adafruit fill() function,
	so requires Adafruit_NeoPixel library v1.1.7 or newer.

2) Added the cycle flag to the effects that did not have it implemented.

3) Refactored many effects, because the flash memory footprint was
	getting too big to fit in my Arduino Leonardo. Some of the effects
	don't look exactly the same, but they're pretty close.

4) Changed the ICU effect from a built-in effect to a custom effect,
	since it was quite large and removing it from the built-in effects
	made more room for custom effects. It always seemed like a specialty
	effect to me anyway.

5) Refactored the Matrix custom effect so it can be configured from 
	outside of the Matrix.h file.

6) Refactored the ws2812fx_webinterface example sketch to take advantage
	of flex box layout and a more modern color picker.

7) Added API for managing idle/active segments.
	a) segment arrays are now configured at runtime instead of compile
		time, allowing more flexibility in allocating SRAM for
		that data (see the new WS2812FX constructor).

	b) The number of segments and the number of segment_runtimes
		are independent now, allowing for more fine grained SRAM
		allocation and the creation of "idle" segments that are
		activated at a later time. See the new
		ws2812fx_segment_sequence example sketch.

8) Increased the maximum number of custom effects from 4 to 8.

9) Substantial refactoring of the segment code to use global variables
	instead of macros, which makes sketches significantly smaller.

10) added setPixels() function to allow users to manually manage the
	underlying Adafruit_NeoPixel pixel data.


v1.2.4 changes 5/8/2020
------------------------

1) Fixed the Static effect, so that it uses the segment's speed parameter
    instead of hardcoding the speed to 500. Makes the Static effect more
    responsive to mode changes.
    See https://github.com/kitesurfer1404/WS2812FX/issues/220.

2) Fixed Random Chase custom effect to work when brigtness < 255.
    See https://github.com/kitesurfer1404/WS2812FX/issues/217.

3) Updated the Running Lights effect to use two colors instead of just one.
    See https://github.com/kitesurfer1404/WS2812FX/issues/221.

4) Added the Matrix custom effect to demonstrate animating a 2D LED matrix.
    See https://github.com/kitesurfer1404/WS2812FX/issues/216.


v1.2.3 changes 2/1/2020
------------------------

1) Fixed minor type casting problem that was generating "comparison between
	signed and unsigned integer expressions" warnings when compiling for
	Teensy.

2) Added "depends=Adafruit NeoPixel" parameter to library.properties.
	see https://github.com/kitesurfer1404/WS2812FX/pull/205

3) Added the Heartbeat custom effect. Just in time for Valentine's Day. :)


v1.2.2 changes 12/21/2019
------------------------

1) Refactored the ws2812fx_segments_web example sketch to allow the use
	of ArduinoJson v6, and replaced the materialize front-end UI framework
	with Material Components for the Web (https://material.io/develop/web/),
	since support for Materialize seems to be fading.

2) Updated esp8266_webinterface example sketch to allow setting a specific
	speed.

3) Refactored the RainbowLarson and Trifade custom effects so they work
	properly when used in more than one segment (removed static variables).

4) Added the TwinkleFox custom effect

5) Updated the Flash Sparkle effect to implement SIZE option.


v1.2.1 changes 9/12/2019
------------------------

1) Refactored the ws2812fx_dma example sketch to use the proper NeoPixelBus API.

2) Incorporated chrissicool's suggestion to remove platform restriction for
	PlatformIO users, as well as some other minor tweaks to library.json.
	See https://github.com/kitesurfer1404/WS2812FX/pull/186

3) Updates to README.md and WS2812FX Users Guide.md

4) Fixed the comments at the top of the RainbowFireworks.h custom effect


v1.2.0 changes 6/11/2019
------------------------

1) Removed segment reset when changing effect color or speed

2) Updated the fireworks effect to use all three segment colors

3) Added rainbowFireworks custom effect


v1.1.9 changes 4/22/2019
------------------------

1) Added ws2812fx_esp32 example sketch

2) update RUNNING_LIGHTS mode to take SIZE option into account

3) added getNumBytesPerPixel() helper function


v1.1.8 changes 3/6/2019
------------------------

1) Added ArduBadge to README.md

2) Added fade_out(uint32_t) and setColor(uint8_t, uint8_t, uint8_t, uint8_t)
	functions for more flexibility

3) fixed random16() bug that was causing incorrect results when run on
	Arduino. See https://github.com/kitesurfer1404/WS2812FX/issues/161

4) Enhancement to ws2812fx_patterns_web example sketch to make it
	more compatible with ArduinoJson v6. The current production
	version of ArduinoJson v6 (v6.9.1) works well.

5) Added fillerup custom effect


v1.1.7 changes 1/18/2019
------------------------

1) Updated the User Guide

2) Updated the ws2812fx_patterns_web example sketch so that it
	could use version 5 or version 6 of the ArduinoJson library.
	(as I write this, ArduinoJson v6 is beta software and has some
	issues, so please stick with v5 if you can)

3) Added another variant of the setSegment() function with this
	parameter signature:
	setSegment(uint8_t, uint16_t, uint16_t, uint8_t, uint32_t, uint16_t, uint8_t)

4) Fixed a bug in the Larson Scanner effect that caused it to
	crash if the length of the segment is 1. Fixes issue #145:
	https://github.com/kitesurfer1404/WS2812FX/issues/145

5) Updated the Rain custom effect to make use of all three colors.
	See the comment section at the top of the Rain.h file.

6) the esp8266_webinterface example sketch was refactored so it
	would compile with the new ESP8266 core platform v2.5.0-beta.
	The	new toolchain throws an "lvalue required as unary '&' operand"
	error when compiling this statement:
	uint32_t tmp = (uint32_t) strtol(&server.arg(i)[0], NULL, 16);
	which was changed to this:
	uint32_t tmp = (uint32_t) strtol(server.arg(i).c_str(), NULL, 16);

7) fixed a bug in the ws2812fx_patterns_web example sketch that made
	it incompatible with LEDfx v1.0.1. Thanks Niklas.


v1.1.6 changes 12/14/2018
------------------------

1) A couple changes to the ws2812fx_patterns_web example sketch
	to make it more robust and implement a new feature that allows
	patterns to be individually enabled/disabled.

2) Added a copyPixels() function to make it easier to create
	scrolling effects.

3) Added the rain custom effect, which makes use of copyPixels().

4) My apologies for the rapid pace of changes to WS2812FX lately.
	The library gets a fair amount of attention in prep for my
	Christmas display. These updates have been pushed out every
	couple of weeks, which I admit is excessive, but it's easier
	for me to manage a few small updates rather then one ginormous
	one. Happily, I think this should be it for a while. :)
	Happy holidays everyone.


v1.1.5 changes 12/6/2018
------------------------

1) Added a SIZE option. It works similar to the FADE_RATE
	option, affecting the size of blocks of pixels in some
	of the effects. See the Users Guide for details,

2) Added random16() function to generate 16-bit random numbers.

3) Fixed several bugs with the Block Dissolve custom effect.

4) Fixed a bug with the RUNNING_RANDOM effect that would cause
	it to misbehave when used with very long segments.

5) Refactored the THEATER_CHASE and SCAN effects to make them
	more efficient and reduce their overall memory footprint.

6) Refactored the DUAL_LARSON custom effect to replace static
	variables with run-time variables. You can now have more
	then one segment assigned to the DUAL_LARSON effect.

7) Updated the library version number in the library.json and
	library.properties files. Forgot to do this in v1.1.4,
	so that version never got pushed out to the Arduino IDE
	Library	Manager. Oops, sorry.


v1.1.4 changes 12/1/2018
------------------------

1) Refactored the custom effect code to make it more flexible. You
	can now dynamically assign custom effects to any one of the
	four _modes[] 'slots' by using the setCustomMode(index, name, *p)
	function.

2) Fixed a bug in the DualLarson custom effect that caused it to
	misbehave if it was assigned to a segment that didn't span
	the entire LED strip.

3) refactored the Popcorn custom effect to fix a bug with pixels
	spilling over into adjacent segments and to implement the REVERSE
	option.

4) added getNumBytes() function to retrieve the number of bytes
	allocated to the Adafruit_NeoPixel pixels[] array. Handy to
	know if you want to directly manipulate the array data.

5) refactored the ws2812fx_patterns_web example sketch to accommodate
	upcoming enhancements to it's companion Android app, LEDfx.
	https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.champlainsystems.ledfx

6) Updated the Users Guide to add some additional information about
	custom effects.


v1.1.3 changes 11/10/2018
------------------------

1) Removed WS2812FX's _brightness variable. Didn't seem to be
	needed, since the Adafruit_NeoPixel lib has it's own brightness
	variable. Keeping the two variables in sync was sometimes a
	problem, so removing _brightness seemed the easy solution.

2) Refactored the serial_control example sketch to remove use of
	the String class. That reduced the flash memory footprint by
	about 1900 bytes, so the sketch now fits in an Arduino Leonardo.

3) Added the ws2812fx_limit_current example sketch to show how to
	limit current by dynamically adjusting brightness.

4) Added intensitySum() and intensitySums() functions to calc the
	sum of LED intensities. Can be used for rudimentary power
	calculations (see ws2812fx_limit_current example sketch).

5) Removed the call to show() in the init() function, since this
	could potentially cause problems trying to update the LEDs
	before they were properly initialized.

6) Fixed a bug in the color_blend() function that caused the
	FX_MODE_FADE effect to misbehave when run on an Arduino that
	uses 16-bit integers.

7) Added the Popcorn custom effect.


v1.1.2 changes 10/25/2018
------------------------

1) Various enhancements to the ws2812fx_segments_web example sketch.

2) Minor enhancement to the DualLarson custom effect.

3) Added pause() and resume() functions.

4) Added resetSegmentRuntime() and isTriggered() functions.

5) Minor updates to the documentation.


v1.1.1 changes 10/10/2018
------------------------

1) Fixed a bug introduced in v1.1.0 of the ws2812fx_custom_effect
	example sketch.

2) Updated the ws2812fx_segments_web example sketch to use the
	latest version (v1.0.0) of the materialize UI framework
	(https://materializecss.com/). Also added a brightness slider.

3) added resetSegmentRuntimes() and getSegmentRuntimes() functions.

4) added get and set functions for segment mode, speed, colors and options.

5) Fixed the getLength() function so it would return the number
	of LEDs in the strip, not just the number of LEDs in the first
	segment.

6) Added the ws2812fx_msgeq7 example sketch to show how to use
	WS2812FX with a MSGEQ7 chip to create a spectrum analyzer.


v1.1.0 changes 9/12/2018
------------------------

1) Potential breaking change! The two getSegment functions,
	getSegment() and getSegmentRuntime(), have been changed to return
	pointers to their respective data structures rather then references.
	This allows the segment data to be updated, rather then be read-only.
	I don't think these	functions are used by the vast majority of
	WS2812FX users, since they're intended for advanced developers that
	have a need to dynamically manipulate the inner workings of the
	library. They're primarily used to create custom effects. Since
	the functions now return pointers the syntax for using them changes
	from this:
		WS2812FX::Segment seg = ws2812fx.getSegment();
  		int seglen = seg.stop - seg.start + 1;
	to this:
		WS2812FX::Segment* seg = ws2812fx.getSegment();
  		int seglen = seg->stop - seg->start + 1;
	All of the custom effects in the src/custom folder have been
	updated to accommodate this change.

2) Another potential breaking change! The AUX_PARAM variables in the
	segment_runtime struct have been refactored to allow some additional
	flexibility in their use. Again this is an advanced feature that no
	one probably uses unless you're writing custom effects, so in all
	likelihood doesn't affect many users. The AUX_PARAM definition
	changed from this:
		uint16_t aux_param;
		uint16_t aux_param2;
	to this:
		uint8_t aux_param;
		uint8_t aux_param2;
		uint16_t aux_param3;
	If you're using aux_param, then you may have to take into
	consideration the new data types.

3) add two new functions, isFrame() and isCycle(), to provide feedback
	about the state of an effect to the user's sketch. isFrame() returns
	true when the LEDs in a	segment	have changed (think of it as a
	"frame" of animation) and isCycle() returns true when a repetitive
	effect starts a cycle. See the ws2812fx_soundfx example sketch for
	an example of how these functions might be used.

4) Three new custom effects: BlockDissolve, RainbowLarson and VUMeter.

5) Created a new example sketch which shows how to add sound effects
	to your light show. See ws2812fx_soundfx.

v1.0.9 changes 8/3/2018
------------------------

1) Created a color_blend() helper function.

2) Refactored the Fade effect to use the color_blend function, so
	you can now fade to a second color (not just black).

3) Tweaked the Scan, Twinkle and Sparkle effects to allow a background
	color other then black.

4) Some performance improvements:
	a) sped up the Running Lights effect by refactoring some division
	operations, which are very slow on Arduino.

	b) sped up the fade_out() function by replacing floating point
	math with integer math.

	c) refactored the Fireworks effects, which were very slow because
	they called the sluggish getPixelColor() function many, many times.

5) added the TriFade and Oscillate custom effects.

v1.0.8 changes 7/25/2018
------------------------

1) Fixed a bug introduced in v1.0.7 that assigned the wrong names
to the Halloween, Fire Flicker and Circus Combustus effects.

2) Some performance improvements:
	a) many effects use the Arduino random() function, which is quite
	slow, so added a fast 8-bit random number generator function
	shamelessly borrowed from the smart, maniacally-focused-on-speed
	FastLED team.

	b) refactored the tricolor_chase() function, which was slower then
	it needed to be.

	c) adjusted MIN_SPEED for speedy ESP devices, so they can run
	animations much faster then pokey Arduinos.

3) added the MultiComet custom effect


v1.0.7 changes 7/19/2018
------------------------

1) Moved the _name array variable out of the WS2812FX class and made
it a global variable. This fixes the problem where putting local
variables in PROGMEM (with the F() macro) caused "section type conflict
with __c" compiler error for ESP implementations.
See this issue: https://github.com/kitesurfer1404/WS2812FX/issues/83

Also, the examples/serial_control sketch was refactored to remove the ugly
code hack used to workaround this problem in the past.

As a bonus, making _name a global variable is more memory efficient and
reduces the Arduino flash memory footprint by 1600 bytes.

2) Expanded the custom effect feature to allow for up to four custom
effects. See the examples/ws2812fx_custom_effect2 sketch for a demo
of using more then one custom effect in a sketch.

3) added a src/custom folder to contain user written custom effects. To
maintain Arduino compatibility, with its limited flash memory, it's not
practical to just incorporating more and more effects into the library.
Creating a folder for custom effects, that users can pick and choose
from, is a first step toward partitioning the mode/effect code base.


v1.0.6 changes 6/12/2018
------------------------

1) Small tweak to theater chase effect to allow using a background color
other then black.

2) Added the ws2812fx_alexa example sketch to demo using an Amazon Echo and
Alexa to control the show.


v1.0.5 changes 5/30/2018
------------------------

1) Added custom effect and custom show sections to the user's guide

2) Added the ws2812fx_dma example sketch to demo a custom show function

3) Updated the ws2812fx_patterns_web example sketch to be able to use
the new gamma and fade rate features introduced in v1.0.4.


v1.0.4 changes 5/13/2018
------------------------

1) fixed breath and fade mode's divide-by-zero bug (caused system to crash
when using those two modes and setting brightness to zero).

2) fixed multi-strobe mode, which was broken since the speed code rewrite.

3) changed customMode from a global variable to an instance variable, so
multiple instances of ws2812fx can each have their own custom effect.

4) added ws2812fx_custom_FastLED example sketch to show how to integrate
FastLED features into WS2812FX.

5) added user's guide.

6) reduced the Arduino flash memory footprint by about 400 bytes.


v1.0.3 changes 5/5/2018
-----------------------

1) rearranged files and created a library.properties files
to comply with the Arduino IDE 1.5 Library specification.

2) additions to the keywords.txt file to highlight new keywords.

3) WS2812FX now uses additional features from the Adafruit_NeoPixel
library. Adafruit_NeoPixel library v1.1.4 or newer is required.

4) New fade function that can fade to any color (not just black)
and the fade speed can be adjusted.

5) Added optional gamma correction.

6) created new setSegment function to config fade and gamma options.
(see WS2812FX.h for #defines to make option config easier)
	i.e. setSegment(segNum, start, stop, mode, colors[], speed, NO_OPTIONS);
	i.e. setSegment(segNum, start, stop, mode, colors[], speed, FADE_FAST);
	i.e. setSegment(segNum, start, stop, mode, colors[], speed, FADE_SLOW);
	i.e. setSegment(segNum, start, stop, mode, colors[], speed, REVERSE & FADE_XSLOW);
	i.e. setSegment(segNum, start, stop, mode, colors[], speed, GAMMA);
