WS2182FX Change Log

v1.0.5 changes 5/30/2018
------------------------

1) Added custom effect and custom show sections to the user's guide

2) Added the ws2812fx_dma example sketch to demo a custom show function

3) Updated the ws2812fx_patterns_web example sketch to be able to use
the new gamma and fade rate features introduced in v1.0.4.


v1.0.4 changes 5/13/2018
------------------------

1) fixed breath and fade mode's divide-by-zero bug (caused system to crash
when using those two modes and setting brightness to zero).

2) fixed multi-strobe mode, which was broken since the speed code rewrite.

3) changed customMode from a global variable to an instance variable, so
multiple instances of ws2812fx can each have their own custom effect.

4) added ws2812fx_custom_FastLED example sketch to show how to integrate
FastLED features into WS2812FX.

5) added user's guide.

6) reduced the Arduino flash memory footprint by about 400 bytes.


v1.0.3 changes 5/5/2018
-----------------------

1) rearranged files and created a library.properties files
to comply with the Arduino IDE 1.5 Library specification.

2) additions to the keywords.txt file to highlight new keywords.

3) WS2812FX now uses additional features from the Adafruit_NeoPixel
library. Adafruit_NeoPixel library v1.1.4 or newer is required.

4) New fade function that can fade to any color (not just black)
and the fade speed can be adjusted.

5) Added optional gamma correction.

6) created new setSegment function to config fade and gamma options.
(see WS2812FX.h for #defines to make option config easier)
	i.e. setSegment(segNum, start, stop, mode, colors[], speed, NO_OPTIONS);
	i.e. setSegment(segNum, start, stop, mode, colors[], speed, FADE_FAST);
	i.e. setSegment(segNum, start, stop, mode, colors[], speed, FADE_SLOW);
	i.e. setSegment(segNum, start, stop, mode, colors[], speed, REVERSE & FADE_XSLOW);
	i.e. setSegment(segNum, start, stop, mode, colors[], speed, GAMMA);
